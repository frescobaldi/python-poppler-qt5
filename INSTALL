Installation:
=============


python-poppler-qt5 installs a single Python module named 'popplerqt5'.

You can install it using pip:

    python -m pip install .


Troubleshooting:
================

The project.py script uses pkg-config to determine the version of the installed
poppler-qt5 library. Methods or classes that are not in the installed poppler-
qt5 library will then also be disabled in the Python binding.

If your system does not provide pkg-config, you can manually specify the poppler
version to use with the --poppler-version option, e.g.:

python -m pip install --config-setting "--poppler-version=0.14.0" .

You may then also need the --include-dirs and --library-dirs options to the
build_ext command if the correct poppler-qt5 header files and libraries can't
be found.

See the output of

sip-build --help

for more options.

Dependencies:
=============

- sip 5 or newer
- poppler-qt5 0.12.0 or newer (poppler-qt5 is part of poppler)
- Qt5
- PyQt5
- Python

To build the popplerqt5 module, header files of Qt5 and poppler-qt5 and sip
files of PyQt5 are needed (sometimes packaged separately in corresponding -dev
packages).
