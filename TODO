TODO:
- make demo.py working with PyQt5

DONE:
- Poppler::Document::newFontIterator() is usable as Python iterable
- Poppler::HighlightAnnotation::Quad.points has been fixed
- support Poppler::InkAnnotation::inkPaths() and setInkPaths()
- cast returned lists of objects like Document::links() to their respective types
- convert to and from QLinkedList
- test Python versions other than 2.6: 3.2.3 works
- add some examples: demo.py added
